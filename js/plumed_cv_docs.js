This is the most basic collective variable and is the distance between two atoms calculated by adding the square root of the sum of squares of the three components of the distance vector.

The distance is calculated as:

where (x1,y1,z1) and (x2,y2,z2) are the positions of the two atoms.

When periodic boundary conditions are used, the minimum image convention is applied. This means that the distance is calculated as the minimum distance between the two atoms considering all periodic images.`,

The radius of gyration (Rg) is a measure of the size and compactness of a molecule. It is defined as the average distance of atoms from the center of mass, weighted by their masses.

Calculate principal component analysis (PCA).

PCA is used to analyze conformational changes by identifying the principal modes of motion. It is based on a set of reference structures (typically from a trajectory) and computes eigenvectors that describe the main directions of structural variation.

The PCA is calculated as:
1. Build a covariance matrix from reference structures
2. Diagonalize the covariance matrix to get eigenvalues and eigenvectors
3. Project the current structure onto the principal components

MOLINFO is used to load molecular information from a PDB file, which allows you to use predefined atom groups based on residue names, chain IDs, and other properties. This is particularly useful for proteins, where you can reference common dihedral angles (phi, psi, omega) and other structural elements.

After loading molecular information with MOLINFO, you can use special atom group syntax like:
- @phi-3 : phi angle for residue 3
- @psi-5 : psi angle for residue 5
- @omega-2 : omega angle for residue 2
- @chi1-4 : chi1 angle for residue 4
- @backbone : all backbone atoms
- @sidechain : all sidechain atoms

This makes it much easier to define CVs for proteins without manually specifying atom numbers.`,

Used to perform metadynamics on one or more collective variables.

Metadynamics is an enhanced sampling method that adds a history-dependent bias potential to the system. The bias is constructed by periodically depositing Gaussian-shaped hills in the CV space. Over time, these hills fill the free energy minima, allowing the system to escape local minima and explore the free energy landscape.

The metadynamics bias is calculated as:
V(s,t) = Σᵢ wᵢ × exp(-Σⱼ ((sⱼ - sⱼᵢ)² / (2σⱼ²)))

where:
- s is the current CV value
- t is time
- wᵢ is the height of hill i

Used to perform Parallel Bias metadynamics.

Parallel Bias metadynamics (PBMetad) is an extension of metadynamics that allows multiple walkers (replicas) to share bias information. Each walker deposits hills that are immediately available to all other walkers, leading to faster convergence and better sampling.

The key advantage of PBMetad over standard metadynamics is that multiple walkers can explore different regions of CV space simultaneously, and the bias from all walkers contributes to filling the free energy landscape.

PBMetad is particularly useful for:
- Large free energy landscapes
- Systems with multiple minima
- When using multiple replicas
- Accelerating convergence`,
